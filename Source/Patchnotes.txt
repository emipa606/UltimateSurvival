Ultimate Survival

(V1.1)

-Beta 18 compatible
-Removed KEM strike until I can balance it with the new orbital stike weapons
-Removed Exosuit until I can fix the "remove all other bionics" bug
-Removed Powercore Mortars until I can balance it with new mortar shells
-Minor changes to recipies and crafting time

Next update will be a big one with a ton of fixes, but for now I just wanted to make it compatible with Beta 18.


(V1.0)

-Barbed Wire added
-Destroyer faction units art added
-Flamethrower now leaves fuel on ground
-Weapons and bionics crafting bench added
-Storyteller code rebuilt to fit new format for A17
-Non-tribal humanoid factions health doubled
-Non-tribal humanoid faction pawns now non-recruitable (still able to harvest organs)
-Raiders do not flee when a bunch die, they will still flee when stealing downed pawns, when they feel they have done enough damage, and when stealing valuable goods
-Drop pod colonists, wanderer colonist joining and refuge chased by enemy greatly increased
-Destroyer faction weapon tags fixed to limit weapon choices
-Destroyer faction no longer spawns from crashed ship or with mech spawns
-Destroyer faction no longer sieges
-Laser turret damage increased, fire rate lowered
-Discriptions throughout entire mod has been completed (I think)
-Minor recipie changes throuout
-Mod combined back into a single mod due to steam workshop. Will look into breaking it up again later.


(v0.3)
- Updated for Rimworld Alpha 17
- Added new Bionics branch to the mod.
- 11 New bionic body parts.
- A new fabric made from power shard dust. Used for some bionic production, fireproof armor and able to be used to make normal clothing.
- Pure Power Crystal item added. Limited use, but plans for expansion
- All research has been moved to its own tab in the research menu.
- Crafting time, value and required materials has been changed in many items.
- Due to the increased need for powershards; pirates, outlanders and mechs now drop more power shards.
- Some code orginization and clean up.

Future Plans:
- Multiple work benches for different types of crafting instead of everything being at the power bench
- Changing the name of bionic bodyparts to something other than "power X" for everything.
- Update all missing item discriptions
- Art for Destroyer faction and a hand full of items, possibly update art on old items.
- Massive balance overhaul of completed mod
- Clean up code for full release
- A rebuild of all pawns in the game. Late game can get pretty laggy due to the number of raiders, I have an idea on how to fix it but it will take a ton of work to implement it. I have it on the back burner for now, but is something I would like done before the full release.



(v0.2)
- Added 3 types of boots and gloves to increase walk speed/work speed.
- Added Powercore Mortar, currently unbalanced and cheap to make. Used to fire Powercore Shells.
- Added Powercore Shells. Used in a standard mortar. Moderate damage and large explosive range, but quite expensive to produce.
- Research for Powercore Shells added.
- Minor code clean-up & orginization.

(v0.1)
-Split the mod into a few different parts. There is now a Core mod, which includes things like power, drugs, the storyteller, difficulty setting, the new raid system and global learning/workspeed changes. There is also now optional packs that require Core, but you can pick and chose what extras you want. There is a turret pack, a weapons and armor pack, and a very very WIP faction pack.
-A new faction. This is a new faction of enemies that do some pretty special things. This is a very early version of this and needs a ton more refining... also art, it really needs art... I cant art well...
-There is now a hand full of new craftable/buyable weapons that fit into the "power" theme. They are strong, but a pain to get your hands on. They need balance work, but should be usable right now (if anything they are a bit underpowered).
-I went though all the files and cleaned some crap up. There is still probably still stuff in there I could clear out, but were still in the early phases of the mod. Things will continue to be cleaned out as I learn more and get closer to an actual release.
-Fixed bugged comms console, its a temp fix, but I had to make the destroyer faction not spawn on the map
-PowerGatlingGun damage dropped from 5 to 1
-Flamethrower damage dropped from 3 to 1
-Heavy turret cost lowered
-Laser turret now has a plasteel cost
-Fixed problem where "Power guns" were not craftable at powerbench.

(No Version Number)
-Everything updated to work for A16
-Because of the change to how turrets work, all firerates have changed slightly
-Powershard combuster cost lowered
-Powercore generator power increased from 10000 to 15000
-new research added, all research fits on the tech tree (at the end) and research points for each research has been reworked.
